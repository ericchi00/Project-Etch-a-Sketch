# Project-Etch-a-Sketch
creating an etch a sketch, following along the criteria on The Odin Project

Used a slider to choose grid size rather than prompting the user to input a grid size

Added 2 buttons, one to reset the grid size back to the inital value of 10 x 10 and another button to reset the grid color back to white
